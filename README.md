# Title
> A Low-Cost, Flexible Printed Circuit-Based Sensor for Accurate Ice Detection on Airborne Vehicles Using Capacitive Oscillation
Techniques

**Notes:**  Okay, so I was wrong on my earlier criticism.  After having more time to spend on your paper, your title did actually check many of the boxes. You addressed part of the problem (high-cost inflexible sensors for airborne ice detection), you covered the novelty(capacitive oscillation), and you even suggested your "results" with "accurate ice detection". It's still pretty long, so here are some ideas to shorten it:


1. **Core Technology**: 
   - One or two words that describe the sensor's fundamental technology (e.g., "Capacitive", "Printed Circuit", "Minimal").

2. **Key Feature or Novelty**: 
   - Highlight what makes the sensor novel or improved (e.g., "High-Sensitivity," "Low Cost", "Flexible").

3. **Primary Application or Functionality**:
   - Briefly indicate the sensor's main use-case or what it measures (e.g., "For Ice Detection on Airborne Vehicles").

Ideas:

1. **"Capacitive Oscillation-Based Ice Sensor for Airborne Vehicles: Low-Cost and Flexible Design"**
   - **Core Technology**: "Capacitive Oscillation-Based"
   - **Key Feature or Novelty**: "Low-Cost and Flexible"
   - **Primary Application or Functionality**: "Ice Sensor for Airborne Vehicles"
  
2. **"Airborne Ice Detection via Low-Cost, Flexible Capacitive Oscillation Sensor"**
   - **Core Technology**: "Capacitive Oscillation"
   - **Key Feature or Novelty**: "Low-Cost, Flexible"
   - **Primary Application or Functionality**: "Airborne Ice Detection"

3. **"Low-Cost Capacitive Sensor for Accurate Ice Detection on Aircraft"**
   - **Core Technology**: "Capacitive"
   - **Key Feature or Novelty**: "Low-Cost, Accurate"
   - **Primary Application or Functionality**: "Ice Detection on Aircraft"

4. **"Flexible Printed Circuit Sensor for Aircraft Ice Detection via Capacitive Oscillation"**
   - **Core Technology**: "Flexible Printed Circuit"
   - **Key Feature or Novelty**: "Capacitive Oscillation"
   - **Primary Application or Functionality**: "Aircraft Ice Detection"

5. **"Aircraft Ice Sensing with Low-Cost, Flexible Capacitive Oscillator"**
   - **Core Technology**: "Capacitive Oscillator"
   - **Key Feature or Novelty**: "Low-Cost, Flexible"
   - **Primary Application or Functionality**: "Aircraft Ice Sensing"

And you could sprinkle "accurate" back in there.

# Abstract
Using a structured format and your original title:

> Current approaches to ice detection on airborne vehicles are often limited by high costs, complexity, and limited adaptability to varying surface structures. This work introduces a low-cost, flexible printed circuit-based sensor designed for accurate ice detection. Utilizing capacitive oscillation techniques, the sensor demonstrated high sensitivity and rapid response time in a range of environmental conditions. The technology has potential applications in aviation safety and weather monitoring, offering improved real-time data collection and hazard prevention. This advancement represents a significant step toward cost-effective, reliable ice detection systems for airborne vehicles.

   # Outline
**Notes:** Screwing around with ChatGPT, this was an outline I came up with. Which is pretty much a typical outline. Your draft so far seems to mirror this, sans the explicit Lit Review and Framework sections. It feels like you should hit the points from I, II, III in your introduction while keeping them at the level appropriate for the journal, i.e., there shouldn't be dozens of papers in your lit review part, just a handful that are key. I've integrated your outline into this.

 I'll spend some more time before we get together on Wednesday.

## I. Introduction
- Background and context
- Problem statement
- Objectives and contributions
- Outline of the paper

## II. Literature Review
- Brief overview of existing sensing technologies relevant to your work
- Identification of gaps in current research
- **Justification for the novel technology** - this is the important part

## III. Theoretical Framework
- Underlying theories or mathematical models
- Assumptions and limitations

## IV. Methodology
- Detailed description of the novel sensor design
- Experimental setup
- Data collection methods
- Validation methods

## V. Results
- Data Presentation: Begin this section with a brief description of the raw data generated from the experiment. Include tables or
figures if they help illustrate your findings.
> **Note**: your draft describes what your data was and how you collected it.  This section is just for the data itself.  Code can go in the appendix.
- Results Summary: Summarize your main findings in an understandable way. Be clear and concise.
- Comparison with existing technologies
- Statistical analysis to substantiate findings

## VI. Discussion
- Interpretation: Explain what the results mean in the context of your experiment. This should be a narrative explanation,
expanding on the key points in your results section.
- Comparison with Previous Studies: Compare your findings to those of previous studies. Are they consistent? If not, why
might this be the case?
> In the previous study Dean, et al, were able to confirm that the dielectric relaxation frequency forms a distinct ratio between the capacitances measured when an interdigitated electrode-based capacitive sensor was frozen in ice. We have now replicated this work instead of using an inverter-based relaxation oscillator to detect changes in frequency.

- Implications: Discuss the implications of your findings. Do they suggest new hypotheses, challenge existing ones, or open new
areas of research?
- Limitations: Every study has limitations. Be transparent about the limitations of your research. Discuss how they might affect your findings

## VII. Conclusion
- Summary of key findings
> The presented low-cost capacitive interdigitated electrode sensor, combined with a minimal circuit network, has demonstrated its capability to accurately detect icing events in real time.
- Contributions to the field
> The sensor's high sensitivity, rapid response time, and reliable ice detection make it a promising candidate for various applications, including aircraft, missiles, and other airborne vehicles, where timely detection of icing events is essential. Additionally, the integration of IoT technology and remote monitoring capabilities provides valuable tools for data collection, analysis, and collaboration. The affordability and effectiveness of this sensor open up new possibilities for capacitive sensing applications in various fields and commercial markets.

- **Suggestions for future work** - this is where you lay the groundwork for paper #2
